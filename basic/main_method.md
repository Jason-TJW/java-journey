# public static void main(String[] args)

Java main method is the entry point of any java program.  
**String[] args** can be changed to **String... args**

## public
It has to be **public** so that java can execute this method on runtime.

**Main.java**
```java
package day01.main_method;

public class Main {
    // non-public main method
    static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World.");
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Error: Main method not found in class day01.main_method.Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```

## static
There is no object of the class present on runtime.  
Thatâ€™s why the main method has to be static so that JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method.

## void
Java main method doesn't return anything.

## main
The name of java main method is fixed, cannot be changed.

## String[] args
Java main method accepts a single argument of type String array. This is also called as java **command line arguments**.

**Main.java**
```java
package day01.main_method;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (String arg : args) {
            System.out.println(arg);
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
[root@dev-vm6 ~]# javac Main.java
[root@dev-vm6 ~]# java Main first second third
first
second
third
```
